This project attempts to predict housing prices in King County, Washington, using 
machine learning models. Both a neural network and multiple linear regression models were used.
The neural network was able to predict the housing prices using 85% of the variability 
between house features and price, and the multiple linear regression using 65%. Users can 
input factors such as latitude, longitude, square feet, and number of bedrooms and bathrooms
to determine an estimated price of their potential home.
